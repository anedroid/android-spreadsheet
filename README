Android Spreadsheet

This is a spreadsheet for Android.  I began working on it in 2011, and 
have worked on it on and off since then.

Currently it can load CSV, XLS, XLSX and ODS spreadsheets.

I have functionality to save files, although I will work on that more before
pushing it up.  Other things are a priority before doing that right.

There are a lot of little things that need to be done.  I will work on them
as I can, and accept pull requests and patches as well.

If you send a pull request or patch, have the license for the patch be 
Apache License, Version 2.0.  Include the license boilerplate as a 
comment at the beginning of the pull request.  You can get that here 
https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0#apply .  Replace the 
brackets with the current year and copyright owner, which is yourself 
(or you can also assign copyright to Unwrapped Inc., although this is 
not required).

(If you want, you can dual-license your patch as Apache v2 and GPLv2).

The XLS/XLSX spreadsheet loading is done via the Apache POI library, 
which is under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
